= Route Test Window Quickstart Guide

=== Learning Objectives

* Test your Route rules with the Route Test Window

=== Prerequisites

* Docker

== Route Test Window

The Route Test Window, allows your to easily test your mod_rewrite rules on each Route. It provides information about
the request, the response, rules evaluation, system information and logs.

=== Run the Sample

Use Docker to start an instance of the TAG with the command:

```
docker run -e LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

Access TAG in http://localhost:8080/tag and login with the credentials `admin/admin`. Navigate to the Routes page
http://localhost:8080/tag/route and add the example `RewriteRule`:

Of course, we could use our browser to test this particular rule. On the other hand, with the Route Test Window, we
are able to retrieve additional information associated with the execution of the rule to validate that the Route is
working as expected.

To access the Route Test Window, click the dropdown menu on the top right corner and hit `Test`.

Use the relative address `/something` in the `Resource Url` field and then hit the button `Test`. You will notice that
TAG returned a 404 status code Not Found.

If you check the `Routes` tab, you will notice that the reason for it was because the `RewriteRule` failed to match
with the `Resource Url`.

Now, lets try with the right `Resource Url` of `/tomitribe`:

Now we get a 200 OK, which is the expected response of the http://www.tomitribe.com webpage.

If we check the `Routes` tab again, we get a breakdown of all the steps executed for the `RewriteRule`.

== Summary

This guide introduced to you a feature of the TAG, the Route Test Window. With the Route Test Window you are able to
test your routes in the comfort of the TAG with multiple scenarios.

The Route Test Window supports Requests with multiple Authentication methods, Basic, OAuth2, or Signatures. Headers,
Query and Form parameters can be added, removed or modified from the Request. Each scenario can be saved and reused
later.

The Route Test Window is the tool to quickly validate or debug a Route configuration.
