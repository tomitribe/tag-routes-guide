= Routing Simple Proxy Quickstart Guide

=== Learning Objectives

* Write a simple rewrite rule to proxy a website

=== Prerequisites

* Docker

== Routing

Routing is an essential concept of the TAG. It allows you to authenticate, authorize and modify each incoming request,
before resending it to any underlying service based on its URL.

It implements the same rule-based rewriting engine as
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html[mod_rewrite, window="_blank"], with just a few minor
differences. https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html[mod_rewrite, window="_blank"] provides a
flexible and powerful way to manipulate URLs using an unlimited number of rules. Each rule can have an unlimited
number of attached rule conditions, to allow you to rewrite URL based on server variables, environment variables,
HTTP headers, or time stamps.

=== RewriteRule Directive

To write your first Route, we need a Rewrite Rule. Let's start with a simple one:

```
RewriteRule "^/tomitribe$" "https://www.tomitribe.com" [P]
```

A Rewrite Rule requires the directive `RewriteRule` followed by a pattern `^/tomitribe$` to match the incoming request
URL, a substitution `\https://www.tomitribe.com` to rewrite the request if matched, and finally one or more flags in
square brackets `[P]` to modify the behavior. The `^` and `$` characters delimit the beginning and the end of the
pattern to be matched.

=== Run the Sample

Use Docker to start an instance of the TAG with the command:

```
docker run -e LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

Access TAG in http://localhost:8080/tag and login with the credentials `admin/admin`. Navigate to the Routes page
http://localhost:8080/tag/routes and add the example `RewriteRule`:

Assuming that TAG is running in http://localhost:8080, this rule will match all the incoming requests to TAG to the
URL http://localhost:8080/tomitribe and Proxy to the substitute address https://www.tomitribe.com due to the `[P] flag.

Now, in the browser of your choice, if you try to access the address http://localhost:8080/tomitribe, you should get
the Tomitribe website proxied through TAG:

You may notice that the website is not displaying properly. This is due to the fact that we are only rewriting the
main address after the slash. A web page is usually composed of several other files, like images or css’s. The
addresses of these files also need to be rewritten. Let’s add the following rewrite rule to our route:

```
RewriteRule "^/(.*)$" "https://www.tomitribe.com/$1" [P]
```

The pattern portion of a `RewriteRule` is a Perl compatible regular expression. This `RewriteRule` will now match any
pattern and proxy all incoming requests to https://www.tomitribe.com also adding the previous pattern match after
the slash via the substitution pattern `$1`.

So if the webpage is requesting the file `wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tomitribe-logo@2x.png`, TAG will request it to
https://www.tomitribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tomitribe-logo@2x.png.

Now the web page should display correctly:

== Summary

This guide was a quick introduction to the TAG Routes mechanism and the supporting engine of mod_rewrite. It teached
you how to write a simple RewriteRule to proxy requests. This could be used to proxy websites, REST endpoints or any
kind of traffic that goes through HTTP.

RewriteRule with Proxy behaviour is one of the most basic building blocks to build your orchestration layer on top of
your API’s.
