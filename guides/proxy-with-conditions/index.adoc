= Proxy With Conditions Quickstart Guide

=== Learning Objectives

* Use conditions to control the flow of the Route

=== Prerequisites

* Git
* Java
* Maven
* Docker

=== RewriteCond Directive

The RewriteCond directive defines a rule condition. One or more RewriteCond can precede a RewriteRule directive. The
following rule is then only used if both the current state of the URI matches its pattern, and if these conditions are
met:

```
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} PUT [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} DELETE
RewriteRule "^/movies(.*)$" "http://host.docker.internal:9080/movie-api/api/movies$1" [P,A]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !POST
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !PUT
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !DELETE
RewriteRule "^/movies(.*)$" "http://host.docker.internal:9080/movie-api/api/movies$1" [P]
```

These rules will inspect the http method and if it matches POST, PUT or DELETE, it will evaluate the RewriteRule
directive in the rule set.

=== Run the Sample

Use Git to clone the following Github repository: https://github.com/tomitribe/tag-routes-quickstart-guide.

Build the code with Maven:

```
mvn clean install
```

Run the sample app with:

```
mvn tomee:run
```

This will run a Movie App sample with a few REST endpoints available at http://localhost:9080/movie-api/api/movies.
We are going to route to these endpoints and apply authentication to some of them.

Use Docker to start an instance of the TAG with the command:

```
docker run -e LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

Access TAG in http://localhost:8080/tag and login with the credentials `admin/admin`. Navigate to the Routes page
http://localhost:8080/tag/routes and add the example `RewriteRule`:

TIP: You can copy paste the sample from this guide.

IMPORTANT: You may need to adjust the hostname pattern in the `RewriteRule`. This is because the way Docker resolves
the locahost host is different in each OS. If you are using MacOSX or Windows no change is required. On Linux you may
need to change `host.docker.internal` to simply `localhost`.

The idea of these rules is to apply authentication to methods that can change the data in the Movies Sample Application
while leaving other methods open.

Remember to apply a Basic Auth Profile authorization by selecting ‘Add Authentication’ in the dropdown menu at the
top right corner and adding the ‘A’ flag in the `RewriteRule` directive.

=== Test

Use the Route Test Window, add the address ‘/movies’ in the ´Resource Url´ and hit the button ‘Test’. You should see a
response with the list of movies that exist in the application.

Use the Route Test Window again and try to create a new Movie by using changing the select box ´Method´ to ´POST´,
keep the address ‘/movies’ in the ´Resource Url´ and the following JSON Payload:

[source,json]
----
{
  "title": "The Terminator",
  "director": "James Cameron",
  "genre": "Sci-Fi",
  "year": 1984,
  "rating": 8
}
----

Hit the button ‘Test’. You should now get a 401 Unauthorized. This is because Authentication is being applied since
the calling method is a POST.

If you check the `Routes` tab you will notice that the `Basic Auth Profile` profile failed. In fact, it failed because
we did not send any Authentication information.

Use the Route Test Window again with the same previous information. This time, let's add the Basic Authentication
information by using the option ‘Add Basic Auth’ in the dropdown menu. Fill in the username and password with the
default account ‘admin/admin’.

We also need to add the `Content-Type` header to indicate we are sending JSON. To simplify, we are just going to say
that our `Content-Type` is `*/*`.

image::proxy-with-conditions-07-content-type-header.png[]

Hit the button ‘Test’. You should now get a 200 - OK response code.

image::proxy-with-conditions-08-post-ok.png[]

And the 'Routes' tab everything is also ok:

image::proxy-with-conditions-09-routes-ok.png[]

Finally, try to repeat the step where we get the list of the movies. Use the Route Test Window, add the address
‘/movies’ in the ´Resource Url´ with the `Method` `GET` and hit the button ‘Test’. To confirm that the movie we just
added shows in the list.

image::proxy-with-conditions-10-list-added.png[]

Seems that the `The Terminator` is now on our movies list.

If we check the `Routes` tab, we will notice something interesting. We can tell that the `RewriteCond` for the methods
`POST`, `PUT` or `DELETE` failed to evalute, so the next `RewriteRule` was not executed. Proceeding with the
evaluation the next `RewriteCond` succeed and the `RewriteRule` is executed to retrieve the movies with a `GET` method.

== Summary

This guide expanded on the https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html[mod_rewrite, window="_blank"]
engine by introducing the `RewriteCond` directive. It allows you to implement conditional behaviour that control how
the `RewriteRules` are executed.

`RewriteCond` support all kinds of conditional expressions like `EQ`, `GT`, `GTE`, `LT` or `LTE`. Expressions to be
evaluated can originate from the Request like the url, method, query parameters, headers, cookie values and others.
They can also originate from the host, like environment variables, system properties or the host system information.

Use the `RewriteCond` to enhance your `RewriteRules` and route your clients based on your needs.
